    <p>Poverty isn't just about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food,clothing and shelter. However, poverty is more than just not having money. We can also describes poverty as:"Poverty is hunger.Poverty is lack of shelter".Many children around the world grow up in poverty. We as privilaged individuals,what are we doing to help to try help the poor?Countries such as: Ethiopia,Democratic Republic of the Congo,South Sudan,Burundi and etc live in poverty.Some die because they cannot afford proper medical help and nutritional food.</p>

  <h2>What causes Poverty?</h2>
  <p>1.INEQUALITY AND MARGINALIZATION</p>
    <p>Inequality is an easy,but sometimes misleading term used to describe the systematic barriers leaving groups of people without a voice or representation within their communities.For a population to escape poverty,all groups must be involved in the decision-making process-especially when it comes to having a say in the things that determine your place in society.Gender inequality,caste systems,marginalization based on race or tribal affiliations are all economic and social inequalities that mean the same thing :Little to no access to the resources needed to live a full,productive life.When combined with different combinations of vulnerability and hazards which comprise the rest of this list-a marginalized community may become even more vulnerable to the cycle of poverty.</p>

  <p>2.CONFLICT</p>
    <p>Conflict is one of the most common forms of risk driving poverty today. Large-scale,protracted violence that we've seen in areas like Syria can grind society to a halt,destroying infrastructure and causing people to flee(often with nothing but the clothes on their backs)</p>

  <p>3.HUNGER,MALNUTRITION,and STUNTING</p>
    <p>Most would think that poverty causes hunger,but in reality ,hunger is also a cause and maintainer of poverty.If a person doesn't get enough food ,they'll lack the strength and energy needed to do work or their immune system will weaken from malnutrition and leave them more susceptible to illness that prevents them from getting to work.</p>

</div>
    <p>4.POOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN</p>
    <p>Extreme poverty and poor health often go hand in hand.In countries where health systems are weak,easily preventable and treatable illnesses like malaria,diarrhoea and respiratory infections can be fatal especially for ypung children. And when people must travel far distances to get to clinics or pay for medicine ,it drains already vulnerable households of money and assets and can tip a family from poverty into extreme poverty.</p>

    <h3>How can the government assist in alleviating poverty?</h3>
    <div>
    <img src="images/capture5.png">
  </div>
    <p>Poverty in countries globally is a broad and complex issue.A history of unspeakable inequalities and a rocky development path over the last 20 years have left millions below the poverty line.Many individuals would like to help,but how can they get involved? Also, many businesses have acknowledged the dire need of so many disadvantaged citizens.These companies are willing to come alongside the government to help solve the problems.They want to partner in uplifting the socio-economic situation of our countries' poor.</p>

    <p>1.Developing livelihoods</p>
    <p>Alleviating poverty in countries around the world must start with a focus on the poorest of the poor.Government and businesses must work with communities to tackle the issue of poverty by focusing on projects which can generate sustainable income in the community.Reducing poverty requires the creation of jobs and enterprises.</p>

</div>
    <p>2.Providing for basic needs</p>
    <p>Some families are unable to focus on a productive livelihood until they can meet their basic needs.Governments and businesses can supply food and clothing support to the neediest households in the community.Setting people on a productive path is the end goal.If individuals are able to donate toward this this,we can help with distribution of food,clothing and basic necessities to the people of our countries.The poorest of the poor are also more vulnerable when calamity strikes.Governments can also help by providing disaster relief in the event of fire,devastating weather conditions,or other adverse circumstances.</p>

    <p>3.Developing skills and education</p>
    <p>Governmentscan work with several schools in communities and assist with providing necessities and support for the education of young people.We can also have several successfull mentorship programmes,life skills courses and career plotting projects to help the youth.The goal here is to break the poverty cycle and alleviate poverty in countries into the next generation.</p>

    <p>4.Developing the community</p>
    <p>Poverty brings with it a series of societal and mental ills which make it difficult for people to thrive.Governments can run community development programmes with a broader focus than finances alone.Governments can also focus on developing our youth and women and run outreaches such as Mandela Day programmes in South Africa.</p>
    <div>

</div>
    <p>5.Relational focus</p>
    <p>People in affected communities walk an incredibly difficult road.Governments can focus on life guidance and support for those who are struggling.Providing counselling for the distressed ,meeting with community leaders ,developing leaders and praying with community members can provide good relations between community members and the government.</p>

<h4>"Poverty is not an accident.Like slavery and apartheid,it is man made and can be removed by the actions of human beings"-Nelson Mandela</h4>

<p>If we as individuals and the government can work together with our communities,we can break poverty by the roots and better our communities,empower our youth and create a sustainable income for communities.Together we're stronger!!!</p>
